This repository contains open (no passwords/keys) documentation regarding how to develop and maintain the various projects going on at the RPI edition of GK12/3Helix.

 * Google for documentation related to the frameworks we use; Django, Jquery, Bootstrap, etc.
 * And finally, there are some blogs done by previous fellows that may or may not contain useful information
